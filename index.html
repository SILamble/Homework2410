                    <p>ISTP, Master of Chemistry, Artwork Project Manager and would be web developer. Welcome to my first web page about me. 
                    This is where I'll eventually showcase all that I've learned in becoming a web developer but for now here's a little more "about me".</p>
                
                    <p>Based in Manchester, via the Outer Hebrides, Southampton, and Hull. Vice president of a local book club, frequent flyer and sufferer of eco guilt.
                    Making up for 22 years without having pizza by playing catch up and eating all the pizza I can get my mozzeralla covered hands on. Been to Japan twice 
                    and would happily go back again.</p>

                    <p>Bad at Jenga, okay at Connect 4.</p>
